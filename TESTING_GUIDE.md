## 🧪 Testing the WhatsApp Flow

### Step 1: Set Up Twilio Webhook (Local Development)

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   brew install ngrok  # macOS
   # or download from https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. **Start your Next.js dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start ngrok tunnel**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

   Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

4. **Configure Twilio Webhook**:
   - Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
   - Navigate to: Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message
   - Under "Sandbox Configuration":
     - Set "WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN" to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/whatsapp`
     - Method: `POST`
   - Click "Save"

### Step 2: Add Test Data

1. **Create a test building**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO buildings (name, address, whatsapp_business_number, admin_user_id)
   VALUES ('Test Building', '123 Main St', '+14155238886', 'your-admin-user-id');
   ```

2. **Create test residents**:
   ```sql
   -- Owner
   INSERT INTO residents (
     building_id, type, first_name, last_name,
     email, phone, whatsapp_number,
     preferred_language, opted_in_whatsapp, opted_in_email, opted_in_sms
   ) VALUES (
     'building-id-here', 'owner', 'Carlos', 'Rodriguez',
     'carlos@example.com', '+17871234567', '+17871234567',
     'es', true, true, false
   );

   -- Renter
   INSERT INTO residents (
     building_id, type, first_name, last_name,
     email, phone, whatsapp_number,
     preferred_language, opted_in_whatsapp, opted_in_email, opted_in_sms
   ) VALUES (
     'building-id-here', 'renter', 'Maria', 'Lopez',
     'maria@example.com', '+17879876543', '+17879876543',
     'es', true, true, false
   );
   ```

3. **Create a test unit and link residents**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO units (building_id, unit_number, floor, owner_id, current_renter_id)
   VALUES ('building-id-here', '301', 3, 'carlos-resident-id', 'maria-resident-id');
   ```

### Step 3: Test Message Scenarios

1. **Join Twilio Sandbox**:
   - From your phone, send the join code to `+1 (415) 523-8886`
   - Example: `join <your-sandbox-code>`

2. **Test Maintenance Request** (should create maintenance record):
   ```
   Send: "El aire acondicionado no funciona en mi apartamento"

   Expected:
   - ✅ Conversation created
   - ✅ Message saved to database
   - ✅ AI analyzes as "maintenance_request"
   - ✅ Maintenance request created with priority
   - ✅ AI response sent back to you
   - ✅ Admin notification created
   ```

3. **Test General Question** (should get immediate AI response):
   ```
   Send: "¿A qué hora cierra la piscina?"

   Expected:
   - ✅ Conversation created
   - ✅ AI analyzes as "general_question"
   - ✅ AI response sent immediately
   ```

4. **Test Owner → Renter Routing**:
   ```
   From owner's number: "Voy a hacer reparaciones mañana"

   Expected:
   - ✅ Message forwarded to renter
   - ✅ Renter receives notification with owner's message
   ```

5. **Test Emergency** (should flag for human review):
   ```
   Send: "¡Hay una fuga de agua grave en mi apartamento!"

   Expected:
   - ✅ AI detects emergency priority
   - ✅ requiresHumanReview = true
   - ✅ No auto-response sent
   - ✅ Admin notification created
   ```

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

Watch the console for detailed logs:
```bash
npm run dev

# You'll see logs like:
# 📱 [WhatsApp Webhook] Received incoming message
# [WhatsApp] Building found: Test Building
# [WhatsApp] Resident found: Carlos Rodriguez
# [WhatsApp] Analyzing message with AI...
# [WhatsApp] AI Analysis: { intent: 'maintenance_request', priority: 'high' }
# [WhatsApp] ✅ Maintenance request created
# [WhatsApp] ✅ AI response sent
```

## 📢 Testing Broadcasts

### Step 1: Navigate to Dashboard

1. Go to `/dashboard/broadcasts`
2. You should see the new broadcast composer

### Step 2: Create and Send Broadcast

1. **Fill in the form**:
   - Subject: "Reunión de Residentes - Marzo 2025"
   - Message: "Hola! Les invitamos a nuestra reunión mensual el próximo sábado a las 10am en el salón de eventos."
   - Target: Select "Todos" (or choose specific audience)
   - Channel: WhatsApp (checked)

2. **Click "Enviar Anuncio"**
   - Watch the status change in real-time
   - Check the "Anuncios Anteriores" section below

3. **Verify delivery**:
   - All opted-in residents should receive the message
   - Check Twilio logs for delivery confirmations
   - Check database: `sent_count` and `failed_count` should update

### Step 3: Test Different Audiences

1. **Send to Owners Only**:
   - Select "Dueños" as target
   - Verify only owner residents receive it

2. **Send to Specific Units**:
   - Select "Unidades Específicas"
   - Choose 2-3 units from the grid
   - Verify only those units receive it

## 🔍 Debugging Common Issues

### WhatsApp Messages Not Received

**Issue**: Webhook isn't being called
- ✅ Check ngrok is running and URL is correct in Twilio
- ✅ Verify Twilio sandbox is active
- ✅ Check phone number format (+1787... or +1939...)

**Issue**: "Resident not found"
- ✅ Verify resident phone matches WhatsApp number exactly
- ✅ Check `opted_in_whatsapp = true` in database
- ✅ Ensure resident's building_id matches

**Issue**: AI responses fail
- ✅ Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is valid
- ✅ Review console logs for AI errors
- ✅ Fallback response should still work

### Broadcasts Not Sending

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" error
- ✅ User must be logged in
- ✅ Building must belong to logged-in admin

**Issue**: No recipients found
- ✅ Check target audience has residents
- ✅ Verify `opted_in_whatsapp = true` for recipients
- ✅ Ensure whatsapp_number or phone field is populated

**Issue**: Twilio rate limiting
- ✅ Current implementation: 15ms delay between messages (67 msg/sec)
- ✅ Twilio limit: 80 msg/sec
- ✅ Check Twilio console for quota warnings

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Configure Twilio Webhook (Production)

1. Go to Twilio Console
2. Update webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/whatsapp`
3. Test with a real message

### 3. Monitor Production

- **Check Vercel Logs**: Real-time logs in Vercel dashboard
- **Check Supabase Logs**: Database queries and errors
- **Check Twilio Logs**: Message delivery status

### 4. Set Up Alerts

Consider setting up alerts for:
- Failed webhook calls (500 errors)
- High AI error rate
- Failed broadcast deliveries
- Twilio quota warnings

## 📊 Database Queries for Monitoring

### Check Message Flow
```sql
-- Recent conversations
SELECT c.*, r.first_name, r.last_name, r.type
FROM conversations c
JOIN residents r ON c.resident_id = r.id
ORDER BY c.last_message_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Recent messages
SELECT m.*, c.id as conversation_id
FROM messages m
JOIN conversations c ON m.conversation_id = c.id
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Maintenance requests created today
SELECT *
FROM maintenance_requests
WHERE DATE(reported_at) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY reported_at DESC;
```

### Check Broadcast Performance
```sql
-- Broadcast statistics
SELECT
  subject,
  status,
  target_audience,
  sent_count,
  failed_count,
  (sent_count::float / NULLIF(total_recipients, 0) * 100) as success_rate
FROM broadcasts
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Failed broadcasts
SELECT *
FROM broadcasts
WHERE status = 'failed' OR failed_count > 0
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
